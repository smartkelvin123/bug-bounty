     I scan the target domain using subfinder, 
     I then use assetfinder to find more domains
     I then query https://crt.sh/, TO GET MORE SUBDOMIAN and scan the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) 
      I then remove any domains known to be outside the scope of the engagement
     Once I’ve compiled the list of potential domains I want to look closer at, I reverse lookup each domain to get a list of related IPs. This is extremely important since load balancers, caching servers, WAFs, and API gateways can get in the way.
      I then run nmap against each IP address.
      sudo nmap -sS -p- $TARGET_IP -oX "$TARGET_IP.nmap.xml"
      i then use gowithness
      gowitness nmap -f "$TARGET_IP.nmap.xml" -t 10 --timeout 15 -P "$SCREENSHOT_DIR"
      -N : Scans hostnames (for virtual hosting)
–header “string” : Add header to the HTTP request. Useful for mapping to hostname on a virtual host, or any additional headers the system requires.
   i would usually browse through the backlog of images looking for interesting screenshots, taking note of pages that look like API endpoints, login pages, stack traces
   
       

 tip
If you are attacking the 
    /api/v3/sign-up endpoint try to perform bruteforce to /Sing-up, /SignUp, /singup...
Also try appending to the original endpoint bytes like %00, %0d%0a, %0d, %0a, %09, %0C, %20

     dirnames
/api, /api/v1, /v1, /v2, /v3, /rest, /swagger, /swagger.json, /doc, /docs, /graphql, /graphiql, /altair, /playground, /api-docs

   Leveraging DevTools for Analysis
Google Chrome’s DevTools proves to be a valuable asset for analyzing web applications. Open DevTools, navigate to the Network tab, and filter responses to identify terms like “API,” “v1,” or “graphql.” This filter narrows down requests related to API interactions.

     nuclei -u TARGET_HOST -t http/exposed-panels/
     Advanced app detection
To be honest, I like to look for exposed secondary apps a bit differently than the norm.

Usually, I start by conducting a Nmap scan on the target, listening to every port that responds. I then create a targets.txt file based on what is detected since many secondary portals may be hosted on alternate ports.

Finally, I also use the -silent switch, so I only get the results I am after.

It ends up looking something like this:

nuclei -l targets.txt -t http/exposed-panels/ -silent

   VULNERBILITY IN API FRAMEWORK AND HOW TO DETECT API FRAMEWORK /LANGAUGE     https://danaepp.com/how-to-detect-the-programming-language-of-an-api
   JSON deserialization in REST APIs, especially through Javascript. ie: NodeJS/Express
   PHP object injection from unsafe unserialize() from params or POST bodies. OWASP covers this threat quite well.
    
            XXE Injection
       If an API supports the changing of Content-Type to application/xml, you may have an opportunity to abuse that for XXE.
            
    If an API allows the usage of a standard XML parser to process the data, then an injected external entity will be processed on the server side and could lead to information disclosure, LFI, and maybe even escalate to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).        
            
    1) Check the HTTP response headers
         curl -I https://api.spacex.land/graphql/
         
     PHP/x.x.x – the API is written in PHP
     ASP.NET – the API is written in C#
    Express – this API is written in NodeJS
     Next.js – this API is written in NodeJS for use with the React framework
    PleskLin – this API was written in PHP        
       TIP: Don’t rely on this header on its own. Most API security hardening guidelines include recommendations to remove this header or change it to something that it isn’t.
       
       Server – this header will occasionally contain information about the server software being used. For example, Microsoft-IIS/x.x or nginx.
X-AspNet-Version – this header will be present if the API is written in ASP.NET and can help you determine which version is being used.
X-AspNetMvc-Version – this header is present when an API is written in ASP.NET MVC.
Set-Cookie – while it’s not a guarantee, some languages have distinct cookie patterns that may give away what technology is in use. For example, ASP.NET_SessionId, JSESSIONID or PHPSESSID
X-Runtime – this header is often used in Ruby on Rails applications and can give you a good indication that the API is written in Ruby.
            
            
      2) – Observe and Force Errors   /  send an empty payload 
      curl 'http://crapi.apisec.ai/identity/api/auth/signup' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{}' --insecure -s | jq
      
      3) – Look for anomalous behavior in how the API reacts to data
           example, PHP limits you to a maximum of 1,000 GET parameters, and a maximum POST size of 8MB. Express (NodeJS) on the other hand has a maximum    POST size of 100KB.
           The point is if you have indicators of a specific language and you want to check to see, look at the language’s documentation, focusing on the   data limits for GET params and POST body size. You might be surprised how quickly you can test this way. 
            
      4 Test Parameter Pollution    check link  https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/04-Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_Pollution
      
        HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) tests the API’s response to receiving multiple HTTP parameters with the same name; for example, if the parameter name is included in the GET or POST parameters twice.
As an example, imagine this GET request:
        https://api.target.domain/users?name=bob&name=alice
        
      5) check how API handles booleans
      An API built with a more strongly typed language will generally consume a boolean using true and false values. When it’s not (like in Perl or PHP for example), it might use 1s and 0s.

You can take that further and determine what is going on by how true/false values are used. Are the values strings, or actual JSON-based bools? Are they expecting lower case (ie: true/false in Java, Javascript etc) or capital first letter (ie: True/False in Python)?

All great ways to help isolate what programming language is being used.
        
        
     
  
 
API documentation is often publicly available, particularly if the API is intended for use by external developers. If this is the case, always start your recon by reviewing the documentation. 
  
    
   if you identify the resource endpoint of /api/swagger/v1/users/123, then you should investigate the following paths:  or fuzz  directly fuzz for documentation. 
    /api/swagger/v1/users/123,
    /api/swagger/v1
    /api/swagger
    /api
    
        /api/tasks 
    GET /api/tasks - Retrieves a list of tasks.
    POST /api/tasks - Creates a new task.
    DELETE /api/tasks/1 - Deletes a task.
    
    
   check for patterns that suggest API endpoints in the URL structure, such as /api/. Also look out for JavaScript files, it could  contain  API endpoints that you haven't triggered directly via the web browse

    /api/tasks 
    GET /api/tasks - Retrieves a list of tasks.
    POST /api/tasks - Creates a new task.
    DELETE /api/tasks/1 - Deletes a task.

 tip tip
 API endpoints often expect data in a specific format, it may therefore behave differently depending on the content type of the data provided in a request. Changing the content type may enable you to: 
 
    Trigger errors that disclose useful information.
    Bypass flawed defenses.
    Take advantage of differences in processing logic. For example, an API may be secure when handling JSON data but susceptible to injection attacks when dealing with XML.

NOTE 
  make sure you are recording all requests and responses. This will help to download and save all the client side code, cookies, and session data while allowing you to collect all the routes, endpoints, parameters, and JSON data to help you get a good picture of what is going on. and it  So important to make sure you click on every link, feature, and function that you can.
  
  It’s always a good idea to use the highest tier of the application you are testing and enable all features and functions that you can. This will help expose you to the largest surface area of the application.
   don’t just assume you’ve seen it all. Always look for indicators of more functionality
   ****  Check if  removing a paging parameter bring back the entire recordset? Could it make the application unresponsive as it tries to query and pull back all the data? Or does it bring back a known set of data? What if you modify it to bring back an unreasonable number of records? How does that impact application behavior?
  check  how the application itself handles authentication and authorization 
  
  ***Token misuse :  how are API requests authorized? JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or some other opaque data? Are they passed in by an authorization header, some other header, or maybe through a cookie
  
  ***Missing or Mismatched AuthZ : use burpsuite  authorize to find this issues, sometimes developers forget to add logic to authorize requests
  
  ****Cross Tenant Data Leakage : check using CeWL as  a custom word list generator         //https://danaepp.com/a-cewl-way-for-api-discovery
           feed cewl to the url , eample below

  and then  feed the wordlist to your favorite API discovery bruteforcer like Burp Intruder, feroxbuster, ffuf, gobuster, kiterunner   
           
  
  
  
  note: always map how data is passed arround the app, check the structure and schema of objects being passed around. Or how the front end may include logic for input validation that the API itself may not.security controls like rate limiting may impact how much data can be pulled back from an API. Or the fact an API might return too much data that developers may filter out in the front end code, far too late in the process.
  .......... Discovering the patterns developers use to handle data can help inform how you construct your attack payloads, Watch how data is structured
  As an example, do they access data through query parameters on a resource like 
  https://api.example.com/users?name=dana  or do they use a more RESTful URI structure like 
  https://api.example.com/users/dana    that uses route paths as the params? , check how it handles  json to xml or yaml data

  parsing live traffic to and from a web service to  burp and zap
  and also from dev tools and collect all this traffic and then save it to files for processing later
  
tools to check -->  https://github.com/alufers/mitmproxy2swagger
  steps  
 ***  install https://github.com/alufers/mitmproxy2swagger
 ***  set Once in devtools, make sure you select to “Preserve log” and “Disable cache“ in the network tab, This will ensure you record all requests across pageload
 ***  Use the application normally to collect traffic, sign-up, register,password reset, profile update, possible signup for an account with admin privileges, 
           if confident that you have figured out everything the application can do, we can start moving towards weaponizing all this data.
 
 ***  Generate an HTTP Archive (HAR):   use the export tool, which typically looks like a down arrow in devtools 
       
 ***   Import HAR file to create OpenAPI definition :  leverage mitmproxy2swagger to convert the HAR into a rough OpenAPI definition file
       example-> mitmproxy2swagger -i crapi.apisec.ai.har -o crapi.yaml -p http://crapi.apisec.ai -e -f har
       
 ****    Edit the definition files to describe API endpoints
            Open the YAML definition file in your favorite editor and take a look.
           Notice you have a ton of lines that start with “- ignore:/” under the x-path-templates. 
           Go through the file and remove the “ignore:” on any request that appears to be an API call
           
 *****     Generate OpenAPI documentation from the definition
             Now run the same command line to execute a second pass against the definition file:
             mitmproxy2swagger -i crapi.apisec.ai.har -o crapi.yaml -p http://crapi.apisec.ai -e -f har
               Open up the YAML file again. Look how much it has changed.
               
 ****      Test the OpenAPI document in Swagger Editor  -->   https://editor.swagger.io
            Expand any  of the endpoints and take a look at how well defined it is:
            
            ***HOW TO USE YOUR ROGUE API DOCS IN POSTMAN ***
             hook up Postman and BurpSuite together
             Start up Postman. Click on Workspaces → Create Workspace and name it something unique that represents your engagemen
             Import OpenAPI definition file
                On the top left side of the workspace, beside the name you called it, is an Import button. Click that. When prompted use the explorer to 
                find the YAML file you have created. Then hit the Import button.
                can start firing off requests! Don’t forget to start up Burp
                
            ****   ***    ***
            With a little effort, you should now have your own custom API documentation that follows the OpenAPI specification. This allows you to use Postman and BurpSuite together to attack the target API with more precision, and allows you to test endpoints that may or may not be know from any existing or old documentation
            
            Finding Hidden API Endpoints Using Path Prediction
         TIP: Test with both privileged and unprivileged users  and also on paid features  on apps
            When testing API security, prioritize securing both privileged (highest admin access) and standard user access before diving into endpoint recon
          
 *** path prediction -- involves studying the URL structure, endpoint patterns, and other discernible indicators within the API documentation or code
   when seen

      /api/users/update,
      prediction
      /api/users/delete
      /api/users/add.
      
                       API hierarchical relationships

                           /api/users/{id}/profile
               note that During recon, make sure you map all hierarchical relationships to understand where data can be accessed. Sometimes the same resources can be accessed using different URIs, which may have different access controls or business logic.

                     HOW TO FIND ACCESS CONTROL ISSUES IN APIS
                   ****  Document every role the application uses
                   ****   Map roles to permissions
           check  how administrative access differs from normal user access. Are there separate API endpoints, or does the access control mechanism handle this through session management with things like an access control token (ie: JSON web token) or maybe through unique parameters?
     TIP:
      Use a spreadsheet. Define individual permissions by column and roles by row. Then map out which role has which permissions. As an example, I like to color code sensitive perms and quickly cross reference who has access to what, and when. This lets me quickly figure out which user roles I need to attack in my own accounts to get clear vertical privilege escalation for a feature I want to abuse, or users data that I want to access.
     
                **** Determine how authentication and session management impacts access    
                check out this point  
                Is it based on metadata in the request?
                Are roles defined in a claim of the access token?
                What about additional headers or parameters?
               How does a given user differ from other users?
                Is it based on a unique identifier?

    Cross Tenant Data Leak (CTDL)    in API
    CTDL can happen due to configuration issues where multiple tenants use the same infrastructure. For example, if a service provider sets up a cloud-based service for several clients but fails to configure it securely, CTDL can result. Additionally, CTDL can happen due to vulnerabilities in the application software itself, which an attacker can exploit to gain unauthorized access to data from other client accounts.

   methdology
   There is no single methodology for detecting Cross-Tenant Data Leakage (CTDL) in an API. It all comes down to understanding what sensitive data and resources exist in the system, how it’s being protected, and determining how tenant isolation is being maintained.
   
  ****  checking  for authentication and authorization with burp authorize and use the same approach to check for horizontal privilege escalation across tenants and help find CTDL
  
  ***** Pay attention to the security controls for tenant isolation.
    have a good luck on how url that download pdf reposrt, this pdfs may be store in azure storage or aws s3 bucket behind the scenes, check how  api fetches data,Does it include a unique identifier that represents the tenant in the URL?, Is it dynamically constructed based on data in cookies or tokens? Can that be tampered with to allow you to fetch someone else’s data?   
     
     note-- It’s really nothing more than another form of a BOLA vulnerability but with far greater implications.

NOTE -> 
   Some web servers include BOTH via comma-separated concatenation. So if your id was 2 and the admin id was 1, you would actually end up with id=2,1.

     NOTE
     Sometimes you can abuse an API by simply removing a parameter. If the API does not fail securely when a parameter is missing and instead just sets some defaults, it may be possible to taint the request and have the API behave differently than expected.
    ***** Taint the Payload content type
     check the response body, if it json, change to xml
     check if  expose a path to insecure deserialization? Does its input validation routines understand things like XML External Entities (XXE) and adequately safeguard against XXE injection?
     
     ***  polluting JSON properties
     example
     {
         "accountType":"user",
            "userName":"dana",
          "pwd":"password"
     }
     
      change password fixtures
      PUT /api/user
       [...]

    {
       "userName":"dana",
       "pwd":"password"
    }
    what happen when you change the json parameter to this below 
    PUT /api/user
     [...]

     {
        "accountType":"user",
         "userName":"dana",
           "pwd":"password",
         "accountType":"admin"
   }
   You can go further than that though. You can manipulate the JSON properties by changing their data type..
   below is an example of how to use username to taint parameter
   {"userName": "dana"}
   {"userName": true}
   {"userName": null}
   {"userName": 1}
   {"userName": [true]}
   {"userName": ["dana", true]}
   {"userName": {"$eq": "dana"}}
   Try to taint anything and everything you can and observe how the API responds. The failure code paths are usually not as well tested and can expose some interesting vulnerabilities for you to exploit.
   
   How about forcing the parameter pollution right in the first request by forcing a JSON object to be sent instead of raw form data?
POST /myprofile
Content-Type: application/json

{"name"="Dana\",\"role\":\"admin"}

   or 
   GET /api/users/peter/../admin HTTP/1.1

     Bypassing Authentication with NoSQL Injection
     When looking at bypassing authentication in an API, you should start by finding the endpoint responsible for accepting and validating credentials during a user’s login attempt
 NOTE    in MongoDB, you might utilize the ‘$ne‘ operator, equivalent to ‘!=‘,
  A basic bypass for a Content-Type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded might look like this:
  user[$ne]=fu&pass[$ne]=bar,
  If the login endpoint is accepting JSON, it might look something like this:
   {"user": {"$ne": "fu"}, "pass": {"$ne": "bar" }}
   if you know the user account you want to log in as you can modify the query accordingly. For a user named Bob, it might look like this:
   {"user": "bob", "pass": {"$ne": null }}

     check my recon file for more 
     
     Webhooks
     An API might use a combination of user-controlled data and third-party service URL fragments to construct a URL it will call out to. By manipulating these webhooks, hackers can use an SSRF attack to gain unauthorized access to a server and potentially steal sensitive data or cause other damage.
                
  File Imports
   if an API relies on a URL to import a file, it may be vulnerable to server-side request forgery.
One easy way to test for this is to enter a URL of http://169.254.169.254, the typical cloud metadata service. If the expected file is in any way echoed out or stored for retrieval later, you will be able to see the results from the metadata service request.
      Another way is to use localhost (127.0.0.1) 
    
    PDF Generators
    An attacker can taint the data so that when the PDF is rendered, it may load arbitrary data in the form of server-side XSS. If that XSS contains javascript or embeds an iframe, it may be able to make requests to internal servers and store the results in the PDF.
  
  Local File Read
When looking at SSRF vulnerabilities, it’s good to think outside the box regarding what exactly is causing the server to make a request. If it is fetching a URL with headless server-side code or tools like curl or get, you may be able to leverage alternative protocols to access resources.

As an example, you may be able to replace the http:// protocol with file://, allowing you to access files on the server’s file system. Common examples include something like “?url=file:///etc/passwd“ on a ‘nix-based system or “?url=file://C:/boot.ini” on a Windows-based system.
  note =  you can switch to more complex protocols like gopher://
  
  Accessing Cloud Metadata
  For most cloud services like AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, RackSpace, HP, etc., this is usually 169.254.169.254
For Oracle, it’s 192.0.0.192
For Alibaba, it’s 100.100.100.200
            
     There is a great cloud metadata dictionary published in a GitHub gist by BuffaloWill that you can use during SSRF testing. A quick Intruder payload created in Burp Suite could try to abuse a potential SSRF vulnerability by replacing the target URL with inputs from that dictionary.
            
            Ways to bypass SSRF Protection
            Use Exotic URL Schemas
            dict://
file://
ftp://
gopher://
ldap://
smtp://
telnet://
tftp://

   Using Hostname Instead of IP
   Non-Standard IP Notation
   Hexadecimal – 0xa9fea9fe
Integer – 2852039166
IPv6 – ::ffff:a9fe:a9fe
Octal – 025177524776


  Open Redirects
And last but certainly not least is abusing open redirects to bypass SSRF user input filter protections. If we can host a simple script on a domain we can control and access with an HTTP redirect, we may be able to cause a 302 redirect to the internal servers we wish to access that might otherwise be filtered.

     *****SERVER-SIDE PROTOTYPE POLLUTION (SSPP).   in wepapp-> check if the backend is built with express or node  https://danaepp.com/how-to-exploit-an-api-using-prototype-pollution
     Detecting Server Side Prototype Pollution
    ****      NOTE ***
      When testing client-side prototype pollution, you can easily reverse all your changes and return to a clean environment by simply refreshing the target web page.
That’s more challenging when testing prototype pollution on the server side.
Once you pollute a prototype on the server, this change will persist for the entire lifetime of the Node process, and you don’t have any way of resetting it. This means it can impact production workloads and can negatively impact the API you are testing.

   
    TEST FOR POLLUTED PROPERTY REFLECTION
Look for API endpoints that reflect an object that is created or updated. You can usually find this where objects are created in a POST operation or are updated in a PUT operation.

Consider this example:  
     POST /api/user HTTP/1.1
     Host: vuln-api.com
...
    {
     "user":"bob",
     "firstName":"Bob",
     "lastName":"Smith",
     "__proto__":{
          "foo":"bar"
     }
  }
    and the response
    If the target is vulnerable to SSPP, then you may see a new property called foo with the value of bar reflected in the response:
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
   {
     "username":"bob",
     "firstName":"Bob",
     "lastName":"Smith",
     "foo":"bar"
}
  
  Test for poisoned server configuration changes
     poison configuration  to see if you can abuse the cache control in Express
     Here is how it works. When you send a request with the “If-None-Match” header, you should expect to receive a 304 (not modified) response.
     However, if you found SSPP, you can attempt to pollute the Object prototype on the server by adding cache-control=”no-cache”.   check the above url for this exploit   
      
      If it works, when you send the original request that returned a 304, you SHOULD now get a 200 back with that data and a corresponding ETag, demonstrating its vulnerable.
            
            
      Testing for JSON spaces override
      So Express offers a lot of configurable options in its server framework. One example of this is the fact you can configure how many spaces a JSON object will use to indent any data in the response. You can test this by attempting to pollute the Object prototype by adding “json spaces” and setting it to a larger number than average, like 10 or 15.

If you are testing this with Burp Suite, remember to look at the Raw tab, as the Pretty tab will strip out the extra spaces as it tries to give you easy-to-read JSON output.

This methodology has recently been fixed in Express 4.17.4. But for all those older Express instances out there, you can still abuse this.  

   Scanning for server-side prototype pollution sources
Although it's useful to try manually probing for sources in order to solidify your understanding of the vulnerability, this can be repetitive and time-consuming in practice. For this reason, we've created the Server-Side Prototype Pollution Scanner extension for Burp Suite, which enables you to automate this process. The basic workflow is as follows:

Install the Server-Side Prototype Pollution Scanner extension from the BApp Store and make sure that it is enabled. For details on how to do this, see Installing extensions
Explore the target website using Burp's browser to map as much of the content as possible and accumulate traffic in the proxy history.
In Burp, go to the Proxy > HTTP history tab.
Filter the list to show only in-scope items.
Select all items in the list.
Right-click your selection and go to Extensions > Server-Side Prototype Pollution Scanner > Server-Side Prototype Pollution, then select one of the scanning techniques from the list.
When prompted, modify the attack configuration if required, then click OK to launch the scan.
In Burp Suite Professional, the extension reports any prototype pollution sources it finds via the Issue activity panel on the Dashboard and Target tabs. If you're using Burp Suite Community Edition, you need to go to the Extensions > Installed tab, select the extension, then monitor its Output tab for any reported issues.

BugBountyTip: If you playing with `API ENDPOINT` always try to send `INVALID CONTENT TYPE` end-up by getting hidden endpoints in `RESPONSE` 

tip
If you are testing a JSON endpoint, always try to change one letter in the parameter names to make them invalid. I had quite a few cases where the server thrown back an error with all of the accepted parameters.

     Improper Assets Management

Organizations often include  versioning information in their endpoint names to distinguish between older  and newer versions, such as /v1/, /v2/, /v3/, and so on. APIs still in development often use paths such as /alpha/, /beta/, /test/, /uat/, and /demo/. If you  know that an API is now using apiv3.org/admin but part of the API documentation refers to apiv1.org/admin, you could try testing different endpoints to  see if apiv1 or apiv2 is still active. Additionally, the organization’s changelog  may disclose the reasons why v1 was updated or retired. If you have access  to v1, you can test for those weaknesses.
Outside of using documentation, you can discover improper assets management vulnerabilities through the use of guessing, fuzzing, or brute-force  requests. Watch for patterns in the API documentation or path-­naming  scheme, and then make requests based on your assumptions.
